## About

**I have created this repo to help you understand how an efficient and simple token-based-login-system should work**

If you go through the code, you will understand how to set up:

- ReactJS
- Redux and React-Redux (for state management)
- JWT
- Axios
- Axios interceptors
- Error handling

And on the backend or server-side, you will know how to set up:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- CORS
- Database queries and schemas (in this case, MongoDB)
- Endpoints
- JWT
- Error handling
- And maybe more.

If possible, I might add some more things in the future.
  


## How to run:

Clone the repository by running the following command:  

```

```

To start the backend, open the 'server' directory in your terminal and run:  

```

npm start
```
